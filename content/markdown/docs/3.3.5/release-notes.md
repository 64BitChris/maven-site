# Release Notes &#x2013; Maven 3.3.5

The Apache Maven team would like to announce the release of Maven 3.3.5.

Maven 3.3.5 is [available for download][0].

Maven is a software project management and comprehension tool. Based on the concept of a project object model
(POM), Maven can manage a project's build, reporting and documentation from a central place.

Maven 3 aims to ensure backward compatibility with Maven 2, improve usability, increase performance, allow safe embedding, and pave the way to implement many highly demanded features.

The core release is independent of the plugins available. Further releases of plugins will be made separately.
See the [PluginList][1] for more information.

We hope you enjoy using Maven! If you have any questions, please consult:

- the web site: [http://maven.apache.org/](http://maven.apache.org/)
- the maven-user mailing list: [http://maven.apache.org/mail-lists.html](http://maven.apache.org/mail-lists.html)
- the reference documentation: [http://maven.apache.org/ref/3.3.5/](http://maven.apache.org/ref/3.3.5/)

Bugs
----

 * The Cygwin Shell related handling of the `MAVEN_PROJECTBASEDIR` has been fixed
   with [MNG-5812][MNG-5812].

 * The new scripts to call Maven had introduced a bug related to the handling of the
   `MAVEN_OPTS` and debugging options which has been fixed by [MNG-5813][MNG-5813].

 * Since Maven 3.3.1 it is possible to have configurations stored on a per project base in the 
   `${maven.projectBasedir}/.mvn` folder of the project. There you can use the `maven.config` 
   file to store command line options instead of repeating them every time you call maven.
   In cases where the given file has been empty Maven ended with a failure. This has been fixed
   with [MNG-5816][MNG-5816].

 * The handling of the relativePath in a parent has been fixed related to the case
   that the parent has the same groupId:artifactId but a different version. In this
   case the resolution must be done against the repository.
   This has been fixed by [MNG-5840][MNG-5840].

 * In cases where you start Maven in the root of a windows drive maven will fail.
   This has been fixed by [MNG-5796][MNG-5796]. 

Improvement
-----------

 * Maven 3.3.5 has been enhanced to support mapping phases to goals with custom configurations.
