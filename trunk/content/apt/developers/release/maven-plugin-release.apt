Releasing A Maven Plugin

  Releasing a Maven plugin is much the same as any other Maven project. The following
  guide walks through most of the steps:

    * {{{./maven-project-release-procedure.html} Maven Project Common Release procedure}}
  
  Note that plugins have particular conventions for deploying the project site.
  When encountered in the release process above, perform the following steps:
  
* Staging the latest documentation

  Once the release is prepared, but before the release vote, the site needs to be staged.

  The plugin parent POM will be configured (TODO) to publish the documentation in Apache svn
  https://svn.apache.org/repos/infra/websites/production/maventest/latest (directory name to be discussed to match the intent).

   [[1]] Stage the documentation for the current release version (not the new snapshot).

+------+
cd target/checkout
mvn site-deploy -Preporting
svn cp https://svn.apache.org/repos/infra/websites/production/maventest/latest/plugins/maven-XXX-plugin \
       https://svn.apache.org/repos/infra/websites/production/maventest/content/plugins/maven-XXX-plugin-Y.Z
+------+

   <<Note:>> You should verify the deployment of the site on the Maven website
   (you need to wait {{{http://www.apache.org/dev/cms.html#svnpubsub}snvpubsub}}), which should be a matter of seconds.

+-----+
http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-XXX-plugin-Y.Z/

* Deploying the release website

  After the release has passed, the site needs to be uploaded.

  TODO: make choice between multiple solutions:

  [[a]] svn copy

+-------+
svnmucc -U https://svn.apache.org/repos/infra/websites/production/maventest/content/plugins \
       rm maven-XXX-plugin cp maven-XXX-plugin-Y.Z maven-XXX-plugin
+-------+

  [[b]] change symlink: TODO find an easy way to change a symlink created in svn, like https://svn.apache.org/repos/infra/websites/production/maventest/content/ant-tasks

  []

* Updating the Maven site

 Use the CMS to update {{{http://maventest.apache.org/plugins/}/plugins/}} page, made easy with the bookmarklet.
